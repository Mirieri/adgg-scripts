## Script for MySQL Database Backup

This script uses the `os` library to create a MySQL database backup by executing the `mysqldump` command with appropriate options.

### Variables

-   `DB_HOST`: The host name or IP address of the MySQL server.
-   `DB_USER`: The username for the MySQL account.
-   `DB_PASSWORD`: The password for the MySQL account.
-   `DB_NAME`: The name of the database to be backed up.
-   `BACKUP_FOLDER`: The path to the backup folder where the backup files will be stored.

### Process

-   The script checks if the backup folder exists, and creates it if it does not.
-   The `mysqldump` command is set with the appropriate options to execute a backup of the specified database.
-   The script iterates over all tables in the database.
-   For each table, the script checks if the `country_id` column exists in the table.
-   If the column exists, the script filters the data by `country_id` column for the backup.
-   A backup file is generated for the current table in the specified backup folder.

Note that the script assumes that the `mysqldump` command is in the system path. If it is not, the full path to the `mysqldump` command must be specified.

## GPS Validation

This script creates a backup of a MySQL database and saves it to a specified folder. It uses the `os` module to interact with the operating system and execute command-line commands.

## Prerequisites

-   MySQL installed on your machine
-   Python 3.x installed on your machine
-   `os` module is available in your Python environment

## Usage

1.  Open the Python script in your preferred editor.
2.  Modify the following variables to match your database credentials and backup folder:

pythonCopy code

`DB_HOST = 'localhost'
DB_USER = 'username'
DB_PASSWORD = 'password'
DB_NAME = 'database_name'
BACKUP_FOLDER = '/path/to/backup/folder'` 

3.  Save the changes.
4.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the script.
5.  Run the script using the following command:

bashCopy code

`python backup_mysql.py` 

6.  The script will create a backup of the database and save it to the specified backup folder.

## How It Works

The script uses the `os` module to execute command-line commands. The following steps are taken:

1.  The script checks if the backup folder specified in the `BACKUP_FOLDER` variable exists. If it doesn't exist, the script creates the folder using the `os.makedirs()` function.
    
2.  The script creates a command string to execute the `mysqldump` utility with appropriate options. The command includes the following options:
    
    -   `-h`: Specifies the host name or IP address of the MySQL server
    -   `-u`: Specifies the username to use when connecting to the MySQL server
    -   `-p`: Specifies the password to use when connecting to the MySQL server
    -   `--databases`: Specifies the database to back up
    -   `--single-transaction`: Ensures a consistent backup by using a single transaction
    -   `--quick`: Ensures a faster backup by retrieving rows one at a time
    -   `-r -`: Redirects the output to stdout so that it can be piped to another command
3.  The script uses the `os.popen()` function to execute the command and read the output. The output is split into a list of table names.
    
4.  The script iterates over the list of table names and checks if the table has a `country_id` column. If it does, the script modifies the `mysqldump` command to filter the data by the `country_id` column using the `--where` option.
    
5.  The script generates a backup filename for the current table and executes the modified `mysqldump` command to save the backup to the specified backup folder.
    
6.  The script repeats steps 4 and 5 for each table in the database.
    

## Notes

-   This script is designed to be run on a Unix-like operating system, such as Linux or macOS. It may not work as expected on Windows.
-   You should make sure to keep your backup files in a secure location, as they contain sensitive data.
-   You can modify the script to back up multiple databases by changing the `DB_NAME` variable to a comma-separated list of database names.

## GPS Validation by Caching

This code is a Python script for geocoding GPS coordinates in a MySQL database using the Google Maps API, and caching the results to improve performance.

## Process

-   The script first establishes a connection to a MySQL database, selects the rows containing GPS coordinates, and loads cached results from a CSV file if available.

-   It then defines two functions: check_cache, which checks if a given GPS location is already in the cache, and geocode, which uses the Google Maps API to geocode a GPS location and update the cache.

-   The script then sets the batch size and number of processes to use for parallel processing, and initializes the processing count. It also defines a callback function to update the processing count after each row is processed.

-   The script then uses a multiprocessing.Pool to parallelize the processing of the rows in batches. It first applies caching to the batch using check_cache, then applies geocoding to the batch in parallel using pool.map. It updates the cache with any new results, and prints out information about each row as it is processed using print.

-   Finally, it saves the updated cache to a CSV file.
