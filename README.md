# Description
## GPS Validation by Caching

This code is a Python script for geocoding GPS coordinates in a MySQL database using the Google Maps API, and caching the results to improve performance.

The script first establishes a connection to a MySQL database, selects the rows containing GPS coordinates, and loads cached results from a CSV file if available.

It then defines two functions: check_cache, which checks if a given GPS location is already in the cache, and geocode, which uses the Google Maps API to geocode a GPS location and update the cache.

The script then sets the batch size and number of processes to use for parallel processing, and initializes the processing count. It also defines a callback function to update the processing count after each row is processed.

The script then uses a multiprocessing.Pool to parallelize the processing of the rows in batches. It first applies caching to the batch using check_cache, then applies geocoding to the batch in parallel using pool.map. It updates the cache with any new results, and prints out information about each row as it is processed using print.

Finally, it saves the updated cache to a CSV file.

## GPS Validation

This script looks like it retrieves GPS coordinates from a MySQL database, uses the Google Maps API to reverse geocode the coordinates and extract the corresponding country, and saves the results in an Excel file. It also applies some logic to determine whether a test has passed based on the country value.

## Process:

-   It imports several modules including googlemaps, mysql.connector, pandas, os, and time.
-   It initializes a googlemaps.Client object with a Google Maps API key.
-   It connects to a MySQL database using the mysql.connector.connect function and retrieves GPS coordinates from a table in the database using the cursor.execute method.
-   It processes the retrieved coordinates in batches using a loop that calls the cursor.fetchmany method and then iterates over the returned rows.
-   For each row, it calls the gmaps.reverse_geocode method to reverse geocode the latitude and longitude coordinates and extract the country name from the result.
-   It then applies some logic to determine whether the test has passed based on the country value, and adds the result to a list of tuples called results.
-   It also updates a processed_records variable and prints a message indicating how many records have been processed so far.
-   Finally, it saves the results in an Excel file using the df.to_excel method and prints a message indicating where the report has been saved.



## Script for MySQL Database Backup

This script uses the `os` library to create a MySQL database backup by executing the `mysqldump` command with appropriate options.

### Variables

-   `DB_HOST`: The host name or IP address of the MySQL server.
-   `DB_USER`: The username for the MySQL account.
-   `DB_PASSWORD`: The password for the MySQL account.
-   `DB_NAME`: The name of the database to be backed up.
-   `BACKUP_FOLDER`: The path to the backup folder where the backup files will be stored.

### Process

-   The script checks if the backup folder exists, and creates it if it does not.
-   The `mysqldump` command is set with the appropriate options to execute a backup of the specified database.
-   The script iterates over all tables in the database.
-   For each table, the script checks if the `country_id` column exists in the table.
-   If the column exists, the script filters the data by `country_id` column for the backup.
-   A backup file is generated for the current table in the specified backup folder.

Note that the script assumes that the `mysqldump` command is in the system path. If it is not, the full path to the `mysqldump` command must be specified.
