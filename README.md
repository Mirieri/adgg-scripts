# GPS Validation Alpha

This code is a Python script for geocoding GPS coordinates in a MySQL database using the Google Maps API, and caching the results to improve performance.

The script first establishes a connection to a MySQL database, selects the rows containing GPS coordinates, and loads cached results from a CSV file if available.

It then defines two functions: check_cache, which checks if a given GPS location is already in the cache, and geocode, which uses the Google Maps API to geocode a GPS location and update the cache.

The script then sets the batch size and number of processes to use for parallel processing, and initializes the processing count. It also defines a callback function to update the processing count after each row is processed.

The script then uses a multiprocessing.Pool to parallelize the processing of the rows in batches. It first applies caching to the batch using check_cache, then applies geocoding to the batch in parallel using pool.map. It updates the cache with any new results, and prints out information about each row as it is processed using print.

Finally, it saves the updated cache to a CSV file.

# GPS Validation

This script looks like it retrieves GPS coordinates from a MySQL database, uses the Google Maps API to reverse geocode the coordinates and extract the corresponding country, and saves the results in an Excel file. It also applies some logic to determine whether a test has passed based on the country value.

Here are some details about the script:

1. It imports several modules including googlemaps, mysql.connector, pandas, os, and time.
2. It initializes a googlemaps.Client object with a Google Maps API key.
3. It connects to a MySQL database using the mysql.connector.connect function and retrieves GPS coordinates from a table in the database using the cursor.execute method.
4. It processes the retrieved coordinates in batches using a loop that calls the cursor.fetchmany method and then iterates over the returned rows.
5. For each row, it calls the gmaps.reverse_geocode method to reverse geocode the latitude and longitude coordinates and extract the country name from the result.
6. It then applies some logic to determine whether the test has passed based on the country value, and adds the result to a list of tuples called results.
7. It also updates a processed_records variable and prints a message indicating how many records have been processed so far.
8. Finally, it saves the results in an Excel file using the df.to_excel method and prints a message indicating where the report has been saved.
